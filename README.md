## 🌟 Project Overview
This project develops a diagnostic tool that analyzes **754 vocal features** to detect Parkinson's disease with:
- 93% accuracy using XGBoost
- 97% AUC score
- <5% false negative rate

**Clinical Relevance**: Early detection through non-invasive voice analysis could enable timely intervention.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Comprehensive EDA** with correlation heatmaps and PCA visualization
- **5 ML models** compared (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, Neural Network)
- **SHAP analysis** for interpretability
- **Feature reduction** (93% accuracy with just 20 top features)

## 📂 Dataset
**parkinson_disease.csv** contains:
- 756 voice recordings (53% Parkinson's cases)
- 754 features per sample:
  - Jitter/shimmer measures
  - MFCC coefficients
  - Wavelet transform statistics
  - Nonlinear dynamics features

Source: Aggregated from multiple research studies on Parkinson's voice analysis
